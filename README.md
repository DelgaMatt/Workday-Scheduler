  ## Usage

  This web application takes a mobile first approach, though it is optimized for larger screens as well. The user is able to enter various tasks for their day onto it's constituent time block and is then able to save their task using the 'save' button to the right of each time block. Their information will be stored onto their system's local storage. When the user refreshes the page, the task will persist.
